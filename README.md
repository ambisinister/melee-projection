# melee-projection

Project Win/Loss given players, skill level, character, past encounters, etc

this includes all the code I wrote to scrape liquipedia / build the database, as well as the code to calculate all the things it needs to calculate

forewarned this code isn't optimized and for the most part isn't well commented, I'll get to that eventually.
